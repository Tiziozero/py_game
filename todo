my idea was to have like if the new coords would end up inside the wall send it back a bit like this for other in collidables:
other_body = other.get_body()
if other_body.x < new_coords.x + this_body.width and new_coords.x < other_body.x + other_body.width:
    # check collision from this going left
    b = other_body.x + other_body.width
    if b > new_coords.x: x = b
    # check collision from this going right
    elif new_coords.x + this_body.w > other_body.x: x = other_body.x - this_body.w

however, if it collides, i'd do this for both x and y dirrections since if it collides with it i'd have to overlap both x and y.

so my thought was to send it back to the dirrection it wasn't overlapping
before it overlaps so for example if the object was moving right into a wall,
it would've been overlapping only in the y axis, not x. so i save that in a
previous position, and when i see that the oject and wall are overlapping,
i check and see that it wasn't overlap



todo:
collision wortks, but sends player to right of collidable.
make it so that it checks wether the plauyer (before collision)
was on the left or right side.
then implement for vertical axis too.
